# VBA_challenge
# 2 The goal of this challenge is to complete these goals:

# 3 Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The total stock volume of the stock. 

# 4 To complete this project I consulted a tutor to help with the first half of the project, and used chat GPT to help with the looping of the script through the 4 Workbooks.
